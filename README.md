üìÉ INSTRUCTIONS
============
## üöÄExecution
Topopt Comec requires the folowing pakages on a 3.xx Python environement:
- Tkinter
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib

To execute it, set the optimizer2D.py, optimizer3D.py, topopt_comec.py in the same folder. and run the topopt_comec.py file.

After launching the programm, a defaut case is created. This last is a force inverter, a clasic test case among compliant mechanisms.

## ‚öôÔ∏èParameters
### Dimensions
The convention used for "dimensions" is classic: (X, Y, Z), but negative values are not accepted. The "volume fraction" coresponds to the filling of the domain and is between 0 and 1.
### ‚óã Void 
It is possible impose a "void" area in the domain. This last is defined by a "shape" (square or circle), a "radius" which must be positive and a "center". To diable this functionality, set the "shape" at -.
### ‚Üí Forces
There must be one input "force" and at least one output force. Their point of application must me inside the domain. A negative "stifness" is accepted and has the same effect as flipping the direction. To diable a "force", set the "direction" at -.
### ‚ñ≤ Supports
There must be at least one "support". They must me inside the domain. To diable a "support", set the "fixed dimension" parameter at -.
### üß± Material
The material is defined by the "Young's modulus" for the elasticity, and the "Poisson's ratio" for the deformation in directions perpendicular to the specific direction of loading. The "Young's modulus" must be between 0 and 10,  and the "Poisson's ratio" must be between 0 and 0.5.
### üíª Optimizer
The optimisation part is a modified version of the [165 line topology optimization code](https://www.topopt.mek.dtu.dk/Apps-and-software/Topology-optimization-codes-written-in-Python) from DTU. It constits of a linear optimization with SIMP method. There is one optimizer file for the 2D case and one for the 3D case, but they operates in the exact same way. The first parameter allows the user to chose the "filter" method between density and sensitivity. The second is about the filter's "radius", which must be stricly positive. The "penalization" factor is used in the SIMP method, and 3 is generaly a good choice. The time per "iteration" is roughly proportional to the total number of element. The number of "iteration" must be positive. Before creating a mechanism with many iterations, it is recomended to visualy check the inputs by running 0 "iteration". The iteration process is updated in the terminal. It is possible to save the result by checking the box "save". This will create a folder named "Results", and place indide the image output as a png file. The box "save" must be checked before clicking "create".

Now it is your turn to create cool mechanims !

Thank you for using Topopt Comec :)

Just Optimize !
