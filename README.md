## What is Topopt Comec?

Topopt Comec helps you design compliant mechanisms — flexible structures that achieve motion through material deformation rather than joints.

Simply draw your domain, set forces and supports, choose your material and optimizer, then watch the algorithm sculpt the optimal shape — in 2D or 3D.

## 🚀Quick Start
### Clone/Download the repo
```cmd
git clone https://github.com/ninja7V/topopt-comec.git
cd topopt-comec
```
### Install dependencies
```cmd

```
### Run
```cmd
python main.py
```
### Create
Tweak the parameters or choose a preset and hit "Create"!

### Export
Once you’re happy with your mechanism, export it for visualization in ParaView or for refinement in your favorite CAD software.

## 📖Wiki
The interface should feel intuitive, but you’ll find detailed visual explanations in the [Wiki](https://github.com/ninja7v/Topopt-Comec/wiki).
